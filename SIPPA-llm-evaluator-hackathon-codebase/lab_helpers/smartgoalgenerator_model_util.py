Tool available:
- fetch_data(data_source) -> {{raw_text, formatted_text, meta}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Call fetch_data EXACTLY ONCE with the data_source: "{data_source}"
2) Use "formatted_text" as your working input. It is newline-separated if the source used '@' row delimiters; otherwise it may be free text/paragraphs.
3) Perform the analysis according to the TASK below.
4) Produce output that matches the OUTPUT CONTRACT below EXACTLY (keys and structure). Output ONLY that JSON object and nothing else.
5) Do not call any other tools. Do not print anything except the final JSON. Do not retry fetch_data.

TASK:
