    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) helps you deploying and operating AI agents securely at scale - using any framework and model. It provides you with the capability to move from prototype to production faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this 5-labs tutorial, we will demonstrate the end-to-end journey from prototype to production using a **Smart Goal Generator Agent**. For this example we will use [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents and the Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 model from Amazon Bedrock. For your application you can use the framework and model of your choice. It's important to note that the concepts covered here can be applied using other frameworks and models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Staging Phases:**\n",
    "- **Phase 1**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional Smart Goal Generator agent\n",
    "- **Phase 2**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Phase 3**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Phase 4**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we'll build a Smart Goal Generator Agent prototype that will evolve throughout the workshop into a production-ready system serving multiple customers with persistent memory, shared tools, and full observability. Our agent will have the following local tools available:\n",
    "- **fetch_data()** - Get patient data from data sources \n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Simple prototype running locally. In subsequent labs, we'll migrate this to AgentCore services with shared tools, persistent memory, and production-grade observability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions\n",
    "* **Python 3.10+** installed locally\n",
    "* **AWS CLI configured** with credentials\n",
    "* **Anthropic Claude 3.7** enabled on [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html)\n",

    "**Note:** If you are running this as a self-paced lab you must run create the cloudformation resources as shown in the workshop self-paced steps. If you have not, then uncomment and run the below code segment"
