    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We show cased the capabilities of AgentCore services to move an agentic use case from prototype to production. You can now invoke your agent runtime from any application. On real world applications, clinciancs expect an user interface to be available. Now it's time to create a user-friendly frontend that customers can actually use to interact with our agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll create a **Streamlit-based web application** that provides customers with an intuitive chat interface to interact with our deployed Customer Support Agent. The frontend will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure Authentication** - User login via Amazon Cognito\n",
    "- **Real-time Chat Interface** - Streamlit-powered UI\n",
    "- **Streaming Responses** - Live response streaming for better user experience\n",
    "- **Session Management** - Persistent conversations with memory\n",
    "- **Response Timing** - Performance metrics for transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Our frontend application connects to the AgentCore Runtime endpoint we deployed in Lab 4, providing a complete end-to-end customer support solution:\n",
