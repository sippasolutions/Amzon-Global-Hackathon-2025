# Project Lineage: SIPPA Solutions & CUNY

**SIPPA Solutions Inc.** is a CUNY-based startup dedicated to developing a digital health platform that empowers individuals to leverage their personal data for better health outcomes.

In partnership with Queens College/CUNY, SIPPA Solutions has secured over **$1.3 million in NSF funding** across multiple rounds. This funding has supported the development of a **digital therapeutic solution for diabetes**, integrating behavioral interventions with robust technical validation.

This comprehensive effort was recognized with the **Best Paper Award** at a leading international conference in health informatics. The project has since advanced to a **clinical trial stage (NCT07032311)**, directed by **Dr. Sachmechi**, Director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at **NYC Health + Hospitals/Queens**. This trial investigates how AI-assisted behavioral interventions, adjunctive to standard care, can improve patient outcomes and enhance clinical workflow efficiency.

# Problem & Solution

## Major Pain Point

A critical and mandatory step in behavioral intervention is the creation of **S.M.A.R.T. goals** (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bounded), which must be precisely tailored to a patientâ€™s specific medical condition (e.g., diabetes, liver disease).

Currently, clinicians or residents must manually review electronic medical records (EMR) and draft these goals. In our clinical investigation, this process has proven **time-intensive and resource-demanding**, requiring both specialized medical expertise and strict adherence to regulatory compliance standards.

## Ideation: AI-Powered Goal Generation

Leveraging our combined expertise in **AI/ML** and **clinical care delivery**, the team proposes an **AI agent system for automated S.M.A.R.T. goal generation**. This approach is designed to:

- Automate and streamline behavioral intervention workflows  
- Significantly reduce clinician workload  
- Enhance the scalability of clinical decision support

# Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for the Amazon Global Hackathon

## Project Scope & Platform

This project serves as a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** demonstrating the feasibility of using the **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** platform. The goal is to establish a **multi-agent, scalable AI environment** complete with **enterprise-grade security, observability, and flexibility**.

## Prototype Specifications

### Scalability & Security

The core system consists of two independent AgentCore runtimes:

1. **Smart-Goal-Generator Agent**  
2. **LLM-Evaluator Agent (LLM-as-Judge)**  

Each agent runs in an **isolated AgentCore runtime kernel** to perform two coordinated tasks:

- Generating S.M.A.R.T. goals from clinician summary notes in EMRs.  
- Evaluating the quality of these goals using the LLM-as-Judge agent.  

### Flexibility

- **Interchangeable LLMs:** Each agent supports seamless substitution of underlying LLMs, regardless of whether the chosen Bedrock model supports system prompts or tools.  
- **Shared Functionality:** Agents share functionalities as tools via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  

### Enterprise-Grade Security

- MCP tools are provisioned through **AWS Lambda**.  
- **AgentCore API Gateway** uses **OAuth2** for secure authorization of all service requests.  

### Observability

- **Amazon CloudWatch** provides runtime logging for effective monitoring, maintenance, and auditing.
